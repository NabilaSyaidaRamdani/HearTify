# HearTify

**Dataset Description**
This dataset contains health-related information for individuals, which will be used to predict the likelihood of having heart disease. The following variables are included:

**Age**: The age of the individual (in years).
**Sex:** The gender of the individual, typically encoded as 1 for male and 0 for female.
**Chest Pain Type:** The type of chest pain the individual experienced. It is a categorical variable with different types of chest pain, each indicating varying levels of severity and potential risk.
Resting Blood Pressure (resting bp s): The individual's resting blood pressure (in mmHg).
**Cholesterol:** The level of cholesterol in the individual’s blood (in mg/dL).
**Fasting Blood Sugar:** A binary variable indicating whether the individual’s fasting blood sugar is greater than 120 mg/dL (1 if true, 0 if false).
**Resting ECG:** The result of the individual’s resting electrocardiogram, which shows the electrical activity of the heart at rest. This variable is categorical, with values indicating normal or abnormal heart rhythms.
**Max Heart Rate:** The maximum heart rate achieved by the individual during exercise (in beats per minute).
**Exercise Angina:** A binary variable indicating whether the individual experiences chest pain (angina) during physical activity (1 if yes, 0 if no).
**Oldpeak:** The depression induced by exercise relative to rest, measured by the ST segment of the ECG (a continuous variable).
**ST Slope:** The slope of the ST segment during exercise, which can indicate potential heart problems (categorical variable).
**Target:** The output variable, indicating whether the individual has heart disease (1 if heart disease is present, 0 if not).
This data will be used to classify whether a person has heart disease or not based on these health parameters.
